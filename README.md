instaVIN
========

Gem for connection to instaVIN and retrieving a report.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'instavin'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install instavin

## Usage

To start, use a configuration block to set up your credentials:

    InstaVIN.configure do |config|
      config.user_id = "xxxx"
      config.password = "xxxx"
      config.api_key = "xxxx"
    end

There are two ways to use the service. Through your own username and password, which are set in the configuration. Or, through an access_token generated by another user's user_id and password, and your API key.

To request an access token for another user:

    InstaVIN.configure do |config|
      config.api_key = "xxxx"
    end

    reports = InstaVIN::Reports.new
    token = reports.access_token(username, password)
    reports.set_auth_with_token(token)
    reports.vtr_report("VIN")

or

    InstaVIN.configure do |config|
      config.api_key = "xxxx"
    end

    reports = InstaVIN::Reports.new(access_token)
    reports.vtr_report("VIN")

There are two reports you can request through the API.
VTR is a full report, SVC is a partial, Salvage and Vehicle Check report.

    reports = InstaVIN::Reports.new
    reports.vtr_report("VIN")
    reports.svc_report("VIN")
